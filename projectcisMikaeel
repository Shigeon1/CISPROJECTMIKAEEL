<h2>AI in Education</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is transforming teaching and learning by teachers and students. ChatGPT and adaptive learning software learn dynamically according to a student's requirement and offer a chance to a student to study at his pace. AI also displaces the teachers from their position using auto-grading and tutoring.</p>

<h3>AI Education Concept</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Personalized learning, access, real-time feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Technology dependence, threat of data privacy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI in Medicine</h2>
<p>AI in medicine allows doctors to conduct robotic surgery, instant patient information, and faster diagnosis. One example of one of the devices that aid in conducting more precise and safer surgery is the Da Vinci Surgical Robot. AI also aids in diagnosing illnesses like cancer at an early stage by interpreting medical scans.</p>

<h3>Da Vinci Surgical Robot</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> More precise surgery, faster diagnosis, better outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Downsides:</strong> Pricy, training required, chance of technical breakdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>From this project, we could envision just how fantastic AI can be applied in schools and hospitals. We were shocked by how rapidly technology is improving. We realized, too, that there should be a tradeoff between innovation and ethics, especially in healthcare.</p>
<p>The feedback that we received helped us to tighten our writing to summary form, with more pictures and diagrams, and with more examples so that it is quicker to read. Something that we are considering today is: how do we bring AI in front of more schools in low-income areas?</p>
